# BB84-protocol-implementation

An implementation of the most famous quantum key distribution protocol. A message sent by Alice to Bob is encrypted and decrypted following the BB84 sifting, correction and advance amplification techniques. Upon the modification of many parameters the effect of a third party thief can be studied. This spript was used in order to generate data that was consecutively analysed.

The second file applies the BB84 protocol to a specific case, free space link communication systems.
The script is specifially coded for a simulation of a Alice -> satellite -> Bob safe quantum channel
communication.
